/*
In eager initialization, the instance of the singleton class is created at the time of class loading.
The drawback to eager initialization is that the method is created even though the client application
might not be using it. Here is the implementation of the static initialization singleton class:
*/
public class EagerInitializedSingleton {

    private static final EagerInitializedSingleton instance = new EagerInitializedSingleton();

    // private constructor to avoid client applications using the constructor
    private EagerInitializedSingleton() {
    }

    public static EagerInitializedSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
