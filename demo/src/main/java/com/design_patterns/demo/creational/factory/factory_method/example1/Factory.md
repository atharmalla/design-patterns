# Factory Design Pattern

* The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes 
and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern takes out the responsibility 
of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class. Letâ€™s first learn how to 
implement a factory design pattern in java and then we will look into factory pattern advantages.
We will see some of the factory design pattern usage in JDK. Note that this pattern is also known 
as Factory Method Design Pattern.
